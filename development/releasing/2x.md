title: Releasing a 2.x Release

# Preparation

Currently, we build 2.x locally instead of via a CI job. To prepare:

1. Pull the latest changes from github
2. Verify that we're not using an incremental or snapshot of wunderboss
3. Verify the `:release-tasks` in `project.clj` are correct for this
   release. Specifically, ensure the versions in the "change" tasks
   are correct, all four of them!

# Releasing

    lein release

That should do the trick. If not, figure out why :)

# Promote the clojars artifacts

Login to [clojars](http://clojars.org), and promote all of the
deployed artifacts {{Does this even matter?}}.

# Release the project in JIRA

# Announce it

* Post it on `immutant.org`
* Notify `immutant-users@`
* Notify `the-core@`
* Notify `clojure@`
* Tweet.
* Set the /topic in `#immutant` IRC channel using ChanServ (if you can).
