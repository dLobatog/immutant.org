  # User List

  The user list is where most discussions occur. The focus of 
  the user list is indeed issues & suggestions related to the 
  use of Immutant. If you think you've found a bug, the user 
  list is an excellent place to start. The community can help 
  determine if you're having a simple usage issue, or have 
  found a true defect.
  
  The developers of the Immutant project participate on the user list regularly.

  # Developer List

  The developer list is where the developers discuss internal designs, 
  choices and complexity. If you are interested in the inner workings 
  and how they are built, the developer list is an excellent resource.
  
  Since the developers also participate on the user list, there is no 
  need to initiate bug reports on the developer list. The developers will 
  escalate true defects to the developer list to determine the proper course of action.
