      ## Bugs

      Bugs are what happens when it just doesn't work the
      way you'd expect it to. Particularly so if we've implied
      that your expectations are correct through documentation
      or examples.
      
      Many bugs reveal themselves in very peculiar circumstances
      that we have not tested for. So when you're telling us about
      a bug, include as much information as possible.  Include details
      about your operating system, your Java version, your Rails version,
      your networking environment, whatever you think might help.

      If you want your bug fixed *really fast*, you'll include with
      your bug report a link to a [git repo](http://github.com)
      containing a small test case demonstrating the problem.  We *love*
      those kinds of bug reports!

      ## Features
  
      Feature requests are always welcome.  We expect Immutant to 
      support many difference use-cases, but we're sure we have not
      thought of them all.  
      
      Let us know what you wish you could do with Immutant, and we'll
      look at getting it on the roadmap.  It may not necessarily be "soon",
      but knowing what everyone wants can only help us in our planning.
