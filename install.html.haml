    There are currently two options for installing Immutant: using the 
    Leiningen plugin and downloading a zip file.

    %h2 Installation via Leiningen

    :markdown
      To install Immutant via the [Leiningen](http://leiningen.org/) plugin, you'll need to
      first install Leiningen, followed by the [lein-immutant](https://github.com/immutant/lein-immutant/)
      plugin.

      Install the plugin by adding it to the plugin
      list in `~/.lein/profiles.clj`:

          {:user {:plugins [[lein-immutant "#{site.latest_plugin_version}"]]}}

      You can determine the current version of the plugin by looking at
      its [page on clojars](http://clojars.org/lein-immutant). _**Note:**
      the plugin requires Leiningen **2.0.0** or greater._

      The plugin provides a number of subtasks, one of which is
      `install`. So installing Immutant is as easy as this:

          $ lein immutant install [--full] [VERSION]

      Without a `VERSION` specified, the latest versioned release
      will be installed. 

      To obtain a specific version, you can specify an incremental build 
      number (ex: `123`) or a released version (ex: `#{latest_release.version}`).
      To obtain the latest incremental build, use `:latest` for the version.

      The plugin will install the *slim* version by default. To
      install the *full* distribution, pass the `--full` option to 
      the `install` subtask.

      Releases installed via the plugin are installed by default under
      `~/.lein/immutant/releases`, and `~/.lein/immutant/current` is
      linked to that release. You can specify an alternative parent
      install directory by passing it as the third argument to
      `install`: 
      
          $ lein immutant install #{latest_release.version} /path/where/you/want/it 

      The plugin will install Immutant there, and link
      `~/.lein/immutant/current` to that version.

    %h2 Installation via Zip Download

    :markdown 
      You can manually download any of the same builds that
      you can install via the plugin as either a *slim* or *full*
      distribution. You can download incremental builds from the
      [builds page](/builds/) and official releases from the [releases
      page](/releases/).
      
      Once you have the zip downloaded, expand it somewhere handy. If you want
      to use the Leiningen plugin with this build, you'll need to set `$IMMUTANT_HOME`:

          $ mkdir immutant-releases
          $ cd immutant-releases
          $ unzip path/to/immutant-dist-{slim,full}.zip
          $ export IMMUTANT_HOME=~/immutant-releases/immutant-#{latest_release.version}-{slim,full}/

    %h3 The Distribution Types
    :markdown
      Starting with release **0.9.0** (and incremental build **750**),
      there are two release distributions available:

      * *slim* - a smaller, lighter weight distribution that only
         includes the functionality needed to run Immutant Clojure
         applications, but not JavaEE applications. 
      * *full* - the full JBossAS distribution with Immutant
         included. If you need to run JavaEE applications alongside
         Clojure apps in the same AS, this is the distribution for
         you.
