We just released Immutant 2.1.3. Most issues addressed in this release
are minor bug fixes and documentation enhancements. 

One not-so-minor bug was discovering that our `:dispatch? false`
option has been broken since 2.1.0. That's fixed now, and should help
to improve compute-bound benchmark results.

One other minor change worth noting is the addition of two functions
to the `immutant.web.undertow` namespace: `http-handler`, which turns
a Ring handler into an [Undertow] `HttpHandler`, and
`graceful-shutdown`, which invokes Undertow's ability to gracefully
shutdown a web server by prohibiting new requests while pending ones
complete. See <a
href='https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT-605'>IMMUTANT-605</a>
for a simple example.

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
libraries backed by [Undertow] for web, [HornetQ] for messaging,
[Infinispan] for caching, [Quartz] for scheduling, and [Narayana] for
transactions. Applications built with Immutant can optionally be
deployed to a [WildFly] cluster for enhanced features. Its fundamental
goal is to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.
