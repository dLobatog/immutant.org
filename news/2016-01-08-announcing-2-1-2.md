We just released Immutant 2.1.2. The only significant change is an
option to more easily enable HTTP/2.0 in `immutant/web`. We've had a
few people ask about it and got tired of telling them to use an
incremental release while we waited to fix enough bugs to justify an
"official" release.

But there simply aren't any bugs to fix. ;)

We updated our [Feature Demo] with an HTTP/2.0 example using a
self-signed certificate since, as you may know, HTTP/2.0 requires SSL.

(Configuring SSL in Java is still terrible, by the way. This release
doesn't address that.)

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
libraries backed by [Undertow] for web, [HornetQ] for messaging,
[Infinispan] for caching, [Quartz] for scheduling, and [Narayana] for
transactions. Applications built with Immutant can optionally be
deployed to a [WildFly] cluster for enhanced features. Its fundamental
goal is to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.
