We're as happy as every single person in
[this crowd](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xiaJbrcmw8) to (finally!)
announce Immutant **1.0.0**.

We only fixed a few edge case bugs in this release. As always, view
our road map [here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for
[Clojure](http://clojure.org). It's an integrated platform built on
[JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7) that aims to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

Not much since [CR1](/news/2013/07/19/announcing-1-0-0-cr1/), a few
bug fixes and documentation updates. See the list of changes below.

## So what's next?

We're already considering some API changes, and we want to perform
some benchmarking. We're interested in extending the Immutant
namespaces to other implementations. We want to come up with some best
practices for both development and production deployment on various
platforms. And continue to make Immutant work seamlessly on OpenShift,
and hopefully other cloud providers, too.

We'll do more writing and speaking, too.

And drinking.

## Get It

The simplest way to install or upgrade to 1.0.0 is via our

installed, take a look at our [tutorials](/tutorials/).
