We're as happy as [something something](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5yGJGTjV2WE)
to announce our latest release of Immutant - version
**_0.7.0_**, hopefully culminating in a 1.0.0 version late winter. As
always, view our road map
[here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for [Clojure](http://clojure.org).
It's an integrated platform built on
[JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7) that aims to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

Since 0.6.0, we've made a couple of changes that could potentially
break your applications:

* Immutant no longer looks in the root of the application for an
  `immutant.clj` initialization file. Instead, it looks on the
  classpath for an 'immutant.init' namespace. For your apps to run
  under 0.7.0, you'll need to move `immutant.clj` to `src/immutant/init.clj`
  and change its `ns` declaration to `immutant.init`.
* [Deployment descriptors](#{doc_chapter_for_version('0.7.0', 'deployment', 'deployment-descriptor')})
  are now evaluated instead
  of just being read in.  This allows for dynamic configuration within
  the descriptor based on external data (system properties,
  environment variables). If you are using the [plugin](/install/) to deploy
  and have upgraded it to 0.14.0, this will not affect you. If you
  are creating descriptors via some other method, you will now need to
  quote any symbols in it.
  
We've also added a few new features:

* If you are working with queues or topics that don't match the
  Immutant naming convention of containing 'queue' or 'topic', you can
  now mark them as queues or topics using the
  [immutant.messaging/as-queue](#{api_doc_for_version('0.7.0', 'immutant.messaging', 'immutant.messaging/as-queue')}) or 
  [immutant.messaging/as-topic](#{api_doc_for_version('0.7.0', 'immutant.messaging', 'immutant.messaging/as-topic')})
  functions.
* Messages can now be encoded as [edn](https://github.com/edn-format/edn).

## Get It

The simplest way to install or upgrade to 0.7.0 is via our
[Leiningen plugin](https://clojars.org/lein-immutant):

    $ lein immutant install 0.7.0

See our [install page](/install/) for more details. Once you have it
installed, take a look at our [tutorials](/tutorials/).
