We're as happy as [Burt Reynolds in the 70's](http://www.curthanksdesign.com/projects/pin-the-mustache-on-burt-reynolds/)
to announce our latest release of Immutant - version
**_0.6.0_**, hopefully culminating in a 1.0.0 version this <strike>fall</strike>winter. As
always, view our road map
[here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for [Clojure](http://clojure.org).
It's an integrated platform built on
[JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7) that aims to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

This is the second release in a row where we have focused on bug fixes and internal refactoring
to clean things up as we approach 1.0.0. Our goal is to have a stable API by the first 1.0.0 beta.

Since 0.5.0, we've made a few API changes, some of which are breaking changes:

* The `immutant.utilities` namespace has been renamed to `immutant.util`.
* The `immutant.daemons` namespace has been reorganized - the most noticeable change
  being the `run` function has been changed to [daemonize](#{api_doc_for_version('0.6.0', 'immutant.daemons', 'immutant.daemons/daemonize')}).
* [immutant.registry/fetch](#{api_doc_for_version('0.6.0', 'immutant.registry', 'immutant.registry/fetch')}) has been deprecated and replaced with [immutant.registry/get](#{api_doc_for_version('0.6.0', 'immutant.registry', 'immutant.registry/get')}).

We've also added a few new features in this release:

* We now expose MBeans for HornetQ destinations and listeners.
* [immutant.dev/reload-project!](#{api_doc_for_version('0.6.0', 'immutant.dev', 'immutant.dev/reload-project!')})
  will now load any data-readers specified by newly added dependencies.

With this release, we're bucking our trend of increasing the size of the distribution - 
0.6.0 17Mb smaller than 0.5.0.

## Get It

The simplest way to install or upgrade to 0.6.0 is via our
[Leiningen plugin](https://clojars.org/lein-immutant):

    $ lein immutant install 0.6.0

See our [install page](/install/) for more details. Once you have it
installed, take a look at our [tutorials](/tutorials/).
