We just released Immutant 2.1.0! New features include support for
[EAP], the latest [WildFly] pre-release, and
[HTTP/2](http://undertow.io/blog/2015/04/27/An-in-depth-overview-of-HTTP2.html),
along with better compatibility with [Datomic]. And a few bug fixes,
docs and small API tweaks. Details below.

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
libraries backed by [Undertow] for web, [HornetQ] for messaging,
[Infinispan] for caching, [Quartz] for scheduling, and [Narayana] for
transactions. Applications built with Immutant can optionally be
deployed to a [WildFly] cluster for enhanced features. Its fundamental
goal is to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

* Immutant's messaging library can now be used with [Datomic] either
  in or out of container, as explained more fully in this
  [post](/news/2015/08/03/datomic/).
* channel timeouts
* disable concurrent job execution (thank contributor)
* We had always planned for Immutant to work with Red Hat's
  commercially-supported [EAP] product by making it work with WildFly,
  which will form the foundation for EAP 7, expected to be released
  next year. But we had enough EAP 6 subscribers asking to run
  Immutant that it made sense to try and backport it. So we did!
* We upgraded our [Undertow] dependency to its latest official
  release, therefore we now support HTTP/2
* We now support 4 -- count 'em, FOUR!!! -- major versions of
  Infinispan for `immutant.caching`. Out of container, we bumped
  Immutant's dependency to Infinispan 7, but when run in EAP, version
  5 is used. And inside WildFly 8.2, version 6 is used, and inside
  Wildfly 10, version 8 is used. Crazy, right? :)
* One potentially breaking change is that we switched the default
  value of the `:singleton` option for `immutant.scheduling/schedule`
  from `true` to `false`, because although singleton jobs need a
  unique identifier, we weren't requiring the `:id` option, so our
  previous default behavior was to fail with a warning. As a
  convenience, you may now pass in the id as the value of
  `:singleton`, thereby collapsing two arguments into one.

All of these issues and more are linked below.
