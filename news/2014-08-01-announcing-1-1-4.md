We're as happy as
[a kid at a basketball game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1uFU4D1pQqo)
to announce Immutant **1.1.4 - "OneFourMoreTheRoad"**.

This is strictly a bug fix release and, unless any new bugs are
reported against it, possibly our last 1.x release. We are now
focusing our efforts on [The Deuce](/news/2014/04/02/the-deuce/). We will
make every reasonable effort to fix any bugs reported against 1.x, but
we will only be adding features to 2.x. As always, view our road map
[here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for
[Clojure](http://clojure.org). It's an integrated platform built on
[JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7) that aims to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

The notable changes in this release are:

* `META-INF/` and `WEB-INF/` directories on your resource path are now
  honored.
* We've restored the needed bits to allow remote jmx connections.
* Recent [cider-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl)
  snapshots require `tools.nrepl` to be on the classpath at the time
  the `project.clj` is resolved, so it's now available.
* We no longer force `tools.logging` to use log4j. **Note:** If you were
  relying on that behavior, see
  [IMMUTANT-464](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT-464).

## Get It

The simplest way to install or upgrade to 1.1.4 is via our
[Leiningen plugin](https://clojars.org/lein-immutant):

    $ lein immutant install 1.1.4

See our [install page](/install/) for more details. Once you have it
installed, take a look at our [tutorials](/tutorials/).

## What's next?

As we said above, we'll be focusing on
[Immutant 2](/news/2014/04/02/the-deuce/), with a tentative alpha
release in the next few weeks.

## Get In Touch
