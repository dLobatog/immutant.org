We're as happy as
[this penguin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYitP5iXVPQ) to
announce Immutant **1.1.0 - "CelloPudding"**.

This is a feature and bug fix release. As always, view our road map
[here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for
[Clojure](http://clojure.org). It's an integrated platform built on
[JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7) that aims to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

* We've upgraded [Infinispan](http://infinispan.org) to its latest
  version: 6.0.0.Final. {{why? maybe talk datomic here?}}
* We've shaved a few seconds off the boot process during application
  deployment. Part of gaining this speedup was no longer loading
  `clojure.tools.logging`, so if your app relies on it, it needs to be
  listed among your dependencies.
* We've tried to reduce the "noise" in our log output. This is part of
  an ongoing process to log appropriate information at the right
  severity level. Feedback always appreciated in this regard.
* You can now alter the logging level for the console output (and
  `server.log`) by setting the `jboss.logging.level` system property
  or by passing `--log-level` to the `immutant run` task of our
  [plugin](/install) (assuming you are running version
  [1.2.0](../lein-immutant-1-2-0) of the plugin or newer).
* In the interest of speeding up our incremental builds, we've dropped
  support for apps using Clojure 1.3. They may still work, but that
  version is no longer a part of our integration tests.
* We've also dropped support for our *full* distribution. We only ship
  a *slim* distro now, providing only the minimal JBoss services
  required to support our Clojure libraries. {{why?}}
* Keyword arguments to our functions are now validated, reducing the
  risk of unexpected behavior due to typos.
* We've expanded our messaging api to include
  [per-queue address settings](#{api_doc_for_version("1.1.0", "messaging.hornetq" "set-address-options")}),
  inspired by [Chas' work](https://gist.github.com/cemerick/6115017).
* [Fressian](https://github.com/clojure/data.fressian) is now a
  supported codec for messaging and caching, inspired by
  [Ian's work](https://github.com/vitalreactor/immutant-fressian).
* Immutant now implements the `URLClasspath` protocol introduced in
  version `0.2.2` of [java.classpath](https://github.com/clojure/java.classpath). {{so what?}}

## Get It

The simplest way to install or upgrade to 1.1.0 is via our
[Leiningen plugin](https://clojars.org/lein-immutant):

    $ lein immutant install 1.1.0

See our [install page](/install/) for more details. Once you have it
installed, take a look at our [tutorials](/tutorials/).

## What's next?

Our plans are to begin development on version 2.x of Immutant, with a
specific emphasis on the ability to optionally embed Immutant
libraries within your app, as opposed to deploying them to a
container. The latter will continue to be supported, of course, as
there are a large class of apps for which it makes sense, but we want
to explore the idea of embedding not only web features but messaging,
caching and scheduling as well. We plan to devote time in the next few
weeks figuring out what this will look like. Expect a blog post with
more details soon.
