We've always [supported scheduling jobs](/tutorials/jobs) using a *cron-style*
syntax. We've now extended that to support a finer-grained *at-style*
syntax:

<pre class="syntax clojure">(require '[immutant.jobs :as job])

(jobs/schedule "my-at-job"
                #(println "I fire 4 times with a 10ms delay between each, starting in 500ms.")
                :in 500   
                :every 10 
                :repeat 3)
</pre>

This functionality is available in recent incremental builds, and will
be in *0.9.0*, which should be released today.

## The Details

Instead of a specification string, at-style jobs are controlled by a set
of options that are passed to the
[immutant.jobs/schedule](#{api_doc_for_version('LATEST','jobs','schedule')})
function, and can be mixed and matched.

We won't go through all of the permutations of the options here - you
can see the details in 
[the docs](#{doc_chapter_for_version('LATEST','jobs')}). Instead, we'll
look at a few examples of usage.

If you specify a job without a cron specification or any *at* options, it
will fire once, immediately:

<pre class="syntax clojure">(jobs/schedule "fire-now"  
               #(println "I'll fire right now, once."))
</pre>

Specifying a job with just a start option (either `:at` or `:in`) will
still only fire once, but at the specified time:

<pre class="syntax clojure">;; you can specify :at as a Date
(jobs/schedule "fire-later"  
               #(println "I'll fire at a-java-util-date, once.")
               :at a-java-util-date)

#inst "2013-02-27T18:29:35.222-00:00" 1361989775222

;; or as ms since the epoch
(jobs/schedule "fire-later2"  
               #(println "I'll fire at 2013-02-27T18:29:35.222, once.")
               :at 1361989775222)

;; :in signifies "ms from now"
(jobs/schedule "fire-in"  
               #(println "I'll fire in 500 ms, once.")
               :in 500)
</pre>

You can control repetition of the jobs with `:every`, `:repeat`, and `:until`:

<pre class="syntax clojure">;; fire every 500 ms, forever
(jobs/schedule "fire-forever"  
               #(println "I'll fire every 500 ms, forever.")
               :every 500)

;; fire every 500 ms until a time in the future
(jobs/schedule "fire-for-a-while"  
               #(println "I'll fire every 500 ms, until a-java-util-date-or-ms-since-epoch.")
               :every 500
               :until a-java-util-date-or-ms-since-epoch)

;; fire 6 times, every 500 ms
(jobs/schedule "fire-repeat"  
               #(println "I'll fire 6 times (:repeat + 1) on a 500 ms interval.")
               :every 500
               :repeat 5)

;; all of the above work with an :at or :in
(jobs/schedule "fire-forever-in-a-bit"  
               #(println "I'll fire every 500 ms, forever, starting in 2500 ms.")
               :every 500
               :in 2500)
</pre>

At-style jobs can be unscheduled just like cron-style jobs by passing
the name to
[immutant.jobs/unschedule](#{api_doc_for_version('LATEST','jobs','unschedule')}),
which will be called on your behalf when the application is undeployed
if you don't do it. They can also be rescheduled by calling schedule
again with the same name. So "forever" in the examples really
means "until undeployed, unscheduled, or rescheduled".

## Can I still use the cron syntax?

Absolutely! The only change that will affect you is the order of
arguments to the `schedule` function have changed (the old order still
works for now, but is deprecated, and will be removed in *1.0.0.Beta1*):

<pre class="syntax clojure">(require '[immutant.jobs :as job])
;; the deprecated signature
(jobs/schedule "old-api-cron-job"  
                   "*/5 * * * * ?"
                   #(println "I fire every 5s, forever."))

;; the new signature
(jobs/schedule "new-api-cron-job"  
                   #(println "I fire every 5s, forever.")
                   "*/5 * * * * ?")
</pre>

At-style jobs are fairly new - please give it a try and [let us
know](/community/) if you have any issues or questions.
