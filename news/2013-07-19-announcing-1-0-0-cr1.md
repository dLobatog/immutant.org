[lein-immutant]: https://github.com/immutant/lein-immutant

We're as
[proud as a peacock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g34DG1fghaU) to
release our first (and hopefully only) candidate release for 1.0.0.
We'll give this release about a week to marinate in the community, and
then roll a final 1.0.0.

We only fixed a few edge case bugs in this release. As always, view
our road map [here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is still an application server for
[Clojure](http://clojure.org). It's an integrated platform built on
[JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7) that aims to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

Mostly bug fixes from a lot of testing and attention to detail. See
the list of changes below.

## A new plugin release

We've also released version 1.0.0 [lein-immutant] plugin - we've made
no changes to it since beta3.

## Get It

The simplest way to install or upgrade to 1.0.0.cr1 is via our
[Leiningen plugin](https://clojars.org/lein-immutant):

    $ lein immutant install 1.0.0.cr1

See our [install page](/install/) for more details. Once you have it
installed, take a look at our [tutorials](/tutorials/).
