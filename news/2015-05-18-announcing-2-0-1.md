title: Immutant 2.0.1 Patch Release
author: The Immutant Team
version: 2.0.1
layout: release
tags: [ releases ]
---

Despite our best efforts, the 2.0.0 final release wasn't perfect.

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
libraries backed by [Undertow] for web, [HornetQ] for messaging,
[Infinispan] for caching, [Quartz] for scheduling, and [Narayana] for
transactions. Applications built with Immutant can optionally be
deployed to a [WildFly] cluster for enhanced features. Its fundamental
goal is to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's changed in this release?

Two main issues: timing out the main call if it hangs and fixing
subscriptions to remote topics.
