title: Immutant 2.0.1 Patch Release
author: The Immutant Team
version: 2.0.1
layout: release
tags: [ releases ]
---

Despite our best efforts, the 2.0.0 release wasn't perfect. This
release fixes the imperfections we're currently aware of.

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an integrated suite of [Clojure](http://clojure.org)
libraries backed by [Undertow] for web, [HornetQ] for messaging,
[Infinispan] for caching, [Quartz] for scheduling, and [Narayana] for
transactions. Applications built with Immutant can optionally be
deployed to a [WildFly] cluster for enhanced features. Its fundamental
goal is to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's changed in this release?

Mainly the following:

* Subscribing to remote topics now actually works
* If your `:main` doesn't return, we abort the deployment inside
  WildFly instead of letting it hang the deployer. See the
  [WildFly guide] for details.

See below for a full list of changes.
