Due to issues with hosting our own mailing lists, we've decided to let
someone else manage them so we can spend more time doing things that
actually matter. Therefore, effective today,
`immutant-user@immutant.org` is now `immutant@groups.google.com`, and
we're retiring `immutant-dev@immutant.org`, since it was rarely used.

If you were subscribed to `immutant-user@immutant.org`, you should
have received an invite to join the new list already. If you didn't
receive it, or weren't on the old list,
[please join](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/immutant).

The archives of the old lists will continue to be available at
<http://immutant.markmail.org/>.

## Why Google Groups?

We wanted something that was simple to manage (or at least simpler
than our existing, broken, ezmlm/qmail setup). We also had requests
from a few of you for something more forum-like, that didn't require
email. Google Groups gives us both of those.
