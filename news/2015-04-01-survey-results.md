Here are
[the results of our recent survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oDC6dOeNnpBWV2RCYkfporz0-KAYRNpYyCFu3wCsk2s/viewanalytics).

First things first: **THANK YOU!** Time is currency in open-source,
and we appreciate the 62 of you who spent a little of it feeding back
your Immutant experience to us.

The results didn't surprise us too much, though it appears we need to
do a bit better job of communicating the improvements of 2.x over 1.x.

Of the minority of folks who evaluated Immutant and decided to use
something else, most of them either hadn't actually used it or had
only used 1.x. So we mayhap have some opportunity there.

Other noteworthy items include the high number of deployments to
internal data centers and interest in clustering. Those two are likely
related. Immutant 2 is far more "cloud friendly" than its predecessor
since it contains no app server, only libraries.

### Final Finally

2.0.0.Final is *imminent*! We're pretty excited about that! :)
