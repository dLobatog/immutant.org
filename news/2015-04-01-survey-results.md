Yes, it's April Fools, but we decided to publish
[the results of our survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oDC6dOeNnpBWV2RCYkfporz0-KAYRNpYyCFu3wCsk2s/viewanalytics)
anyway. Make all the jokes you want. :)

First things first: **THANK YOU!** Time is currency in open-source,
and we appreciate the 62 of you who spent a little of it feeding back
your Immutant experience with us.

The results didn't surprise us too much, though it appears we need to
do a bit better job of communicating the improvements of 2.x over 1.x.

Of the minority of folks who evaluated Immutant and decided to use
something else, most of them either hadn't actually used it or had
only used 1.x. So we mayhap have some opportunity there.

### Final Finally

2.0.0.Final is *imminent*! We're pretty excited about that! :)
