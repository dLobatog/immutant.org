We're as happy as [a kid with a banana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTqn72B2Ajk) to announce
Immutant **1.1.3 - "Already?"**.

This is strictly a bug fix release and, unless any new bugs are
reported against it, possibly our last 1.x release. We are now
focusing our efforts on [The Deuce](/news/2014/04/02/the-deuce/). We will
make every reasonable effort to fix any bugs reported against 1.x, but
we will only be adding features to 2.x. As always, view our road map
[here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for
[Clojure](http://clojure.org). It's an integrated platform built on
[JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7) that aims to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

There are only three changes in this release:

* Files in directories that are created after deployment under
  `resources/' are now visible on the classpath.
* The helper classes needed for
  [cider-nrepl](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider-nrepl) to load
  are now exposed by the appropriate classloader.
* Applications that depend on `org.clojure/tools.logging` and any
  Immutant namespace will now work properly when used outside of the
  container.

## Get It

The simplest way to install or upgrade to 1.1.3 is via our
[Leiningen plugin](https://clojars.org/lein-immutant):

    $ lein immutant install 1.1.3

See our [install page](/install/) for more details. Once you have it
installed, take a look at our [tutorials](/tutorials/).

## What's next?

As we said above, we'll be focusing on
[Immutant 2](/news/2014/04/02/the-deuce/), with a tentative release season
beginning this summer.
