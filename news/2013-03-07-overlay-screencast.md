I put together a quick [screencast] showing how to [overlay] the latest
incremental releases of both Immutant and [TorqueBox] into a single app
server capable of deploying both Clojure and Ruby apps.

Further, I show how those Clojure and Ruby apps can seamlessly
exchange messages and share caches using the respective messaging and
caching libraries from both Immutant and TorqueBox.

Enjoy!
