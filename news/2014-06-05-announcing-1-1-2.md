We're as happy as
[these birds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iY3tEioB4BI) to announce
Immutant **1.1.2 - "CodeName"**.

This is primarily a bug fix release and, unless any new bugs are
reported against it, possibly our last 1.x release. We are now
focusing our efforts on [The Deuce](/news/2014/04/02/the-deuce/). We will
make every reasonable effort to fix any bugs reported against 1.x, but
we will only be adding features to 2.x. As always, view our road map
[here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for
[Clojure](http://clojure.org). It's an integrated platform built on
[JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7) that aims to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

There are only a handful of changes in this release. The highlights are:

* Immutant now properly starts when installed on a non-primary drive
  on Windows systems.
* `log4j.(properties|xml)` and `logging.properties` files are now
  loaded from any classpath elements within the root of your
  application (`resources/`, `src/`, `target/classes/`, etc). This
  allows you to override logging settings on a per-application basis,
  including logging to a separate file. See
  [the docs](#{doc_chapter_for_version('1.1.2', 'jboss', 'sec-5-2')}) for more details.

## Get It

The simplest way to install or upgrade to 1.1.2 is via our
[Leiningen plugin](https://clojars.org/lein-immutant):

    $ lein immutant install 1.1.2

See our [install page](/install/) for more details. Once you have it
installed, take a look at our [tutorials](/tutorials/).

## What's next?

As we said above, we'll be focusing on
[Immutant 2](/news/2014/04/02/the-deuce/), with a tentative release season
beginning this summer.

## Get In Touch

If you have any questions, issues, or other feedback about Immutant,
you can always find us on [#immutant on freenode](/community/) or
