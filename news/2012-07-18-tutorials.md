After our last release, [Dan] asked if we had a tutorial to help a
newbie get started on Immutant.

Good question. 

Well, we **do** have one, sort of, in the form of some blog posts
written over the course of a few months in our [News] section. They're
all helpfully tagged with *getting-started*, in reverse chronological
order...

Well, no, I guess we don't have one. :(

So we decided to take some of those old blog posts, update them, and
organize them into a suite of [tutorials] that are easy to navigate,
and we promise to keep them in sync as the project evolves.

Unlike the blog posts, they're living documents, of course, and though
each is focused on a particular aspect of Immutant, there will be some
overlap between them and our [manual and api docs][documentation],
which we consider more of a reference.

Please don't hesitate to [let us know][community] if the tutorials
make your initial experience with Immutant that much smoother. And
we'd love to hear suggestions for additional ones.
