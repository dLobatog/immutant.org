After our last release, [Dan] asked if we had a tutorial to help a
newbie get started on Immutant.

Good question. 

Well, we **do** have one, sort of, in the form of a some blog posts
written over the course of a few months in our [News] section. They're
all helpfully tagged with *getting-started*, in reverse chronological order...

Well, no, I guess we don't have one. :(

So we decided to take some of those old blog posts, update them, and
organize them into a suite of [tutorials] that are easy to navigate,
and we promise to keep them in sync as the project evolves.

They're living documents, of course, and there will be some overlap
between them and our [manual and api docs][documentation], which we
consider more of a reference. So we're happy to incorporate any
feedback that would make an initial experience with Immutant that much
smoother.
