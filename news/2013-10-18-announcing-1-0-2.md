We're [happy, happy, happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AD7pr0gfJY) to announce Immutant **1.0.2 - "HamBiscuit"**.

This release is primarily a bug fix release, with a couple of other
enhancements thrown in. As always, view our road map
[here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for
[Clojure](http://clojure.org). It's an integrated platform built on
[JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7) that aims to reduce the inherent
[incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

In addition to fixes, we added a few backwards-compatible features:

- It's now [possible](https://github.com/immutant/hotrod-overlay) to
  use Immutant's integrated Infinispan data grid as a
  [Datomic](http://datomic.com) data store. We'll provide more details
  on this in a future blog post.
- We now
  [expose the max number of HTTP connections](/documentation/1.0.2/web.html#sec-11)
  as a system property.
- We've attempted to make the `immutant.cache` API more functional by
  introducing a [swap!](/documentation/1.0.2/apidoc/immutant.cache.html#var-swap%21) function.
- We've added
  [fanout](/documentation/1.0.2/apidoc/immutant.pipeline.html#var-fanout)
  capabilities to our `immutant.pipeline` namespace.
- We now default `:nrepl-port` to 0 when the `:dev` profile is active.

The last item deserves some emphasis. What it means is that unless you
explicitly set `:nrepl-port` to `nil` in either `project.clj` or
`profiles.clj`, you'll get a dedicated nREPL service for any app you
deploy to your Immutant with the `:dev` profile active. When
developing, this is convenient and desired, but it means you should
probably take care to deploy your app to production without activating
the `:dev` profile, i.e. use the `with-profile` Leiningen subtask. The
risk of not doing so is still small as the OS-assigned port is bound
to localhost by default and unlikely to be exposed.

The rest was mostly
[doc enhancements](/documentation/1.0.2/development.html) and bug
fixes, listed below. We wanted to give a special shout-out to
[Ian Eslick](http://ianeslick.com/) for contributing a fix to enable
access to the Immutant session store in Pedestal apps.
