We're pleased to announce the third official release of Immutant -
version **_0.3.0_**. This is the first in a series of bi-monthly
releases culminating in a 1.0.0 version this fall. View our road map
[here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for [Clojure](http://clojure.org). 
It's an integrated platform built on [JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7)
that aims to reduce the [incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity) 
that comes along with real world applications.

## What's in this release?

As we work to harden Immutant, our work has focused less on features
an more on robustness and developer experience, which we expect to
continue through 1.0.0. Highlights of this release include:

* Immutant namespaces are now published to
  [clojars](http://clojars.org) and can be referenced and used (to
  some extent) outside of an Immutant container. This is particularly
  handy for unit testing.
* XA transactions will work seamlessly with any released version of
  `clojure.java.jdbc`
* Dependencies can be added at runtime, via a connected REPL, without
  requiring a redeploy or restart.
* Immutant and its associated lein plugin work on Windows platforms.
* Immutant can now be used in "domain mode", a JBoss AS7 cluster
  management feature.

## Get It

The simplest way to install 0.3.0 is via our Leiningen plugin. See
our [install page](/install/) for more details. Once you have it installed,
