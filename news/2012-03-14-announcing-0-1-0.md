We're pleased as punch to announce the first official release of
Immutant - version **_0.1.0_**. We consider this release to be beta quality,
and lacks some of the features and API stability that will end up in the 
1.0.0 release. 

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for [Clojure](http://clojure.org). 
It's an integrated platform built on [JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7)
that aims to reduce the [incidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity) 
that comes along with real world applications.

## What's in this release?

For this first release, we've focused on the basics of application 
[deployment](#{doc_chapter_for_version( '0.1.0', 'deployment' )}) 
and [initialization](#{doc_chapter_for_version( '0.1.0', 'initialization' )}) 
along with a few components:

* [Ring support](#{doc_chapter_for_version( '0.1.0', 'web' )})
* [Messaging](#{doc_chapter_for_version( '0.1.0', 'messaging' )})
* [Caching](#{doc_chapter_for_version( '0.1.0', 'caching' )})
* [Long-running services (daemons)](#{doc_chapter_for_version( '0.1.0', 'daemons' )})
* [Scheduled jobs](#{doc_chapter_for_version( '0.1.0', 'jobs' )})
* [REPL support](#{doc_chapter_for_version( '0.1.0', 'interactive' )})

## What's next?

Now that we have 0.1.0 out the door, we'll be focusing on:

* XA Transaction support
* Benchmarking to identify (and resolve!) performance bottlenecks
* Getting Immutant running on [OpenShift](http://openshift.com)
* General API simplification and improvement

## Get It

The simplest way to install 0.1.0 is via our Leiningen plugin. See
our [install page](/install/) for more details. Once you have it installed,
take a look at our [Getting Started](/news/tags/getting-started/) tutorials. 
We'll be updating those and adding more in the next couple of weeks.
