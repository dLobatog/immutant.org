A few weeks ago, we put out a short survey to gather information about
how the community is actually using Immutant. We'd like to share our
take on the
[results](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1oDC6dOeNnpBWV2RCYkfporz0-KAYRNpYyCFu3wCsk2s/viewanalytics).

But first things first: **THANK YOU!** Time is currency in open-source,
and we appreciate the 62 of you who spent a little of it feeding back
your Immutant experience to us.

Given the small sample size and the non-rigorous approach we took to
developing the questions, we can't really draw any statistically
significant conclusions, but we can possibly get a general feel of the
community.

Noteworthy items include:

* It appears we need to do a bit better job of communicating the
  improvements of 2.x over 1.x. Of the minority of folks who evaluated
  Immutant and decided to use something else, most of them either
  hadn't actually used it or had only used 1.x. So we mayhap have some
  opportunity there.

* There is a good bit of interest in clustering and a fairly high
  number of deployments to internal data centers. Those two are likely
  related. Immutant 2 is far more "cloud friendly" than its
  predecessor since it contains no app server, only libraries, so we
  may see more publicly-hosted deployments in the future.

* Almost as many 2.x deployments in production as 1.x, even though 2.x
  is still in beta. We're going to chalk this up to the fact that
  1) 2.x has been pretty stable over the course of its *VERY* long
  beta cycle, and b) 2.x is simpler than 1.x.

* Of the folks that have used 2.x, almost as many have used it in
  WildFly as have embedded, which surprised us. We expected a larger
  percentage to be embedded users. It may be that some of the WildFly
  users came from 1.x, and appreciate the value of the container and
  clustering.

## Final Finally

2.0.0.Final is *imminent*! We're pretty excited about that! :)

As always, if you have any questions, comments, or issues with regards
to Immutant, [let us know](/community).
