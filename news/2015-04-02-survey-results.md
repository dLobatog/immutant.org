A few weeks ago, we put out a short survey to gather information about
how the community is actually using Immutant. We'd like to share our
take on the results.

But first things first: **THANK YOU!** Time is currency in open-source,
and we appreciate the 62 of you who spent a little of it feeding back
your Immutant experience to us.

Given the small sample size and the non-rigorous approach we took to
developing the questions, we can't really draw any statistically
significant conclusions, but we can possibly get a general feel of the
community.

The results didn't surprise us too much, though, based on the
comments, it appears we need to do a bit better job of communicating
the improvements of 2.x over 1.x.

Of the minority of folks who evaluated Immutant and decided to use
something else, most of them either hadn't actually used it or had
only used 1.x. So we mayhap have some opportunity there.

Other noteworthy items include:

* A high number of deployments to internal data centers and interest
  in clustering. Those two are likely related. Immutant 2 is far more
  "cloud friendly" than its predecessor since it contains no app server,
  only libraries, so we may see more non-data center deployments in the
  future.

* Almost as many 2.x deployments in production as 1.x, even though 2.x
  is still in beta. {{why? more approachable? we don't know how many
  of those deployments are inside WF, where "approachable" wouldn't
  apply}}

* Of the folks that have used 2.x, almost as many have used it in
  WildFly as have embedded, which surprised us. We expected a larger
  percentage to be embedded users. It may be that some of the WildFly
  users came from 1.x, and appreciate the value of the container and
  clustering.

## Final Finally
