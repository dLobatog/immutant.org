We're as happy as the Seattle Seahawks after
[last night's win](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/25/seattle-seahawks-golden-tate-td-packers_n_1911960.html)
to announce our second bi-monthly beta release of Immutant - version
**_0.4.0_**, hopefully culminating in a 1.0.0 version this fall. As
always, view our road map
[here](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/IMMUTANT).

## What is Immutant?

Immutant is an application server for [Clojure](http://clojure.org).
It's an integrated platform built on
[JBoss AS7](http://www.jboss.org/as7) that aims to reduce the inherent
[accidental complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity)
in real world applications.

## What's in this release?

Highlights include:

* We now support
  [durable topic subscribers](http://www.eaipatterns.com/DurableSubscription.html).
  Simply [pass a `:client-id` to either `receive` or `listen`](#{doc_chapter_for_version('0.4.0', 'messaging', 'sec-3-2')}).
* We're smarter about stopping JMS destinations now. Specifically,
  we'll never stop a durable queue or a topic with durable subscribers
  if it contains undelivered messages. This guarantees message
  delivery even across server restarts.
* When you pass messages that are Clojure data structures, we [pass
  their metadata as filterable JMS properties](#{doc_chapter_for_version('0.4.0', 'messaging', 'sec-3-1')}),
  and [reconstitute it](#{doc_chapter_for_version('0.4.0', 'messaging', 'sec-3-2')}) upon delivery.
* We introduced a [`Daemon` protocol](#{doc_chapter_for_version('0.4.0', 'daemons')}) to the `immutant.daemons`
  namespace. To avoid a naming conflict, we renamed the `start`
  function to `run`.
* We added some options to the [Leiningen plugin](https://github.com/immutant/lein-immutant#running-it)
  to make it very easy to set virtual host and context path options at the command line
  when deploying your app. 
* We reduced application deployment times by about 40%, and we're not done yet.
