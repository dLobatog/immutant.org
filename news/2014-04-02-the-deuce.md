We haven't blogged about anything in a few months because we've been
thinking about how we'd like to improve Immutant. Here are the chief
design goals:

* Just libraries; fully-functional; no container required
* Optionally deployable to a stock [WildFly] or [EAP] container

## Just Libraries

For its second major release, Immutant will simply be a collection of
libraries, one for each of the commodity services available to
applications deployed to an Immutant 1.x container: web, scheduling,
messaging, caching, and transactions. These services will be provided
by the same components available in WildFly 8: [Undertow], [Quartz],
[HornetQ], [Infinispan], and [Narayana], respectively.

So when you embed any Immutant 2.x library in your app, it will not
require a "container" to be fully-functional. There is no required
"installation" step. There is no required "deployment" step.

Just libraries.

## Just WildFly/EAP

Fully-functional libraries are great, but there are still good reasons
to deploy an app to a container, e.g. security, monitoring,
clustering, etc. We want developers to be able to run the exact same
application either outside or inside an app server. When outside, all
functions in the Immutant namespaces will work as expected. But
inside, you get more, automatically, without any changes to your code:

* Web session replication
* Load-balanced message distribution
* Highly-available "singleton" scheduled jobs
* Flexible Infinispan cache replication
* Multiple polyglot app deployments

Immutant 1.x consists of modules and subsystems repackaged on top of a
now-quite-old, forked [AS7] distribution. AS7 is no longer under
active development, of course. All of the innovation is occurring in
[WildFly]. And it became increasingly difficult to cherry-pick
relevant changes into our fork.

So we're going to eliminate that headache in 2.x. Immutant
applications will be deployable into stock, vanilla WildFly/EAP
servers. No modules or subsystems or special deployment descriptors
required. Just a jar file with a little code to setup the classpath
and engage the container's services.

This means no more using Leiningen to resolve dependencies at
deployment, which has been a source of bugs from the more
*adventurous* `project.clj` files.

This also obviates [overlay], another source of bugs. TorqueBox 4.x
apps will work like Immutant 2.x, simple jar files deployed to stock
WildFly/EAP installations, achieving the same features available from
[overlay] today, without the brittle complexity.

## Same Stuff, Less Crap

Development is occurring on our [thedeuce] branch right now, but we'll
merge it to master once we cut a 1.1.1 release. And we're publishing
incremental releases
[here](http://repository-projectodd.forge.cloudbees.com/incremental/).
We'll include more detailed instructions on how to try them in a
future post.

Immutant was inspired by its sister project, [TorqueBox], under active
development for almost 6 years now. Embracing Clojure's REPL, we
strove to make Immutant's libraries more dynamic than TorqueBox. This
caused the API's in each project to diverge somewhat, even though we
have a number of community members who use both together via
messaging, caching, etc.

So Immutant 2.x and TorqueBox 4.x represent an opportunity for both
teams to work together to realign and harden the service API's, with
an eye toward supporting other languages and implementations in the
future. Please join us in either #torquebox or #immutant on
[freenode], to express your opinions and desires.
